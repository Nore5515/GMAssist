DONE

A pet project to work on when I have free time.

My goal is to make a program that is the ultimate GM assistant.

GMAssist v2
--------------------------
1) Random loot generation gives a random number of loot
2) I can get a random village/town/city, complete with overall theme, places to visit, unique landmarks, how people act, how rich/poor it is, etc
3) The random town stuff is all linked together (poor = meaner people = less places to visit)
4) I can generate a random NPC, complete with name, personality, quirk, physical appearance, family members, career, greatest fear, general physique
5) Improve enemy NPCs, with more logical random stats, buttons for different stats, the ability to adjust stats, etc.
