A pet project to work on when I have free time.

My goal is to make a program that is the ultimate GM assistant.

1) Random weather
2) Random structures
3) Random loot
4) Random events
5) Building full stories, beginning, middle and end.
6) Randomly generating enemies with HP, SPD, Attacks and DMG done, AC and DR.
7) Random mini-bosses with all of the above and unique moves.
8) Structures have randomly generated lore.
9) Shops with random gear and equipment with pricing
10) Different themes (like upbeat, dramatic, adventure)
